I'm Aaron Lee, also known as Aaron Koichi. Currently a CS Degree Student and a part-time coding instructor at Eduwel. I started coding at the age of 16. Since then, I have made little to no progress on creating projects outside of 
high school and college, but starting in 2023, I will be creating and posting more personal projects on GitHub for self-improvement.



- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, node.js, data structures and algorithms.
